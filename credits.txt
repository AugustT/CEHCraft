Abstract:
This is 2015 Forestry
Commission National Forest Inventory (NFI) Map for S/E/W/GB. The NFI programme
monitors woodland and trees across Great Britain. The NFI provides an extensive
and unique record of key information about our forests and woodlands. This
dataset includes Interpreted Forest Types (IFTs) for all woodland over 0.5ha
and Interpreted Open Area (IOA) information for areas over 0.5ha that are
completely surrounded by woodland.

Source for Digital Elevation Model (25m)
DATA IDENTIFICATION
Resource title: European Digital Elevation Model (EU-DEM), version 1.1information.png Resource abstract: The EU-DEM v1.1 is a resulting dataset of the EU-DEM v1.0 upgrade which enhances the correction of geo-positioning issues, reducing the number of artefacts, improving the vertical accuracy of EU-DEM using ICESat as reference and ensuring consistency with EU-Hydro public beta.

EU-DEM v1.1 is available in Geotiff 32 bits format. It is a contiguous dataset divided into 100x100 km tiles, resulting in a total of 1992 tiles of 4000x4000 pixel at 25m resolution with vertical accuracy: +/- 7 meters RMSE. The tiles have been grouped in big regions:

- EUDEM2_ASIA (Turkey)

- EUDEM2_ATLAN (Hondo and Fr_Islands)

- EUDEM2_BRITAIN (Thames, Shannon and Tweed)

- EUDEM2_EUROPE_1 (Duero, Ebro, Tajo, Guadalquivir and Jucar)

- EUDEM2_EUROPE_2 (Tirso, Mesima, Tevere and Po)

- EUDEM2_EUROPE_3 (Garonne, Rhone, Loire, Seine and western Rhine)

- EUDEM2_EUROPE_4 (Danube)

- EUDEM2_EUROPE_5 (Skjern, Nemunas, Vistula, Oder, Elbe and Eastern Rhine)

- EUDEM2_EUROPE_6 (Bulgaria and Pinios)

- EUDEM2_ICELAND (Iceland)

- EUDEM2_SCAND (Vorma, Gota, Angerman, Tana, Kemi and Neva)

- EUDEM2_SOUTH_AMERICA (Fr_Guiana)
EU-DEM v1.1 upgrade was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme.

Bias adjustment with ICESat points
Screening and removal of artefacts in the EU-DEM v1.0, including the presence of blunders (i.e. negative or positive anomalies)
Ensuring consistency with EU-Hydro to produce a better river network topology:

EU-Hydro River Network
Resource abstract:
EU-Hydro is a dataset for all EEA39 countries providing photo-interpreted river network, consistent of surface interpretation of water bodies (lakes and wide rivers), and a drainage model (also called Drainage Network), derived from EU-DEM, with catchments and drainage lines and nodes
